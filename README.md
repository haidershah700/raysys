# RAG Bot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation bot built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend, with Flask powering the backend.

## Description

RAG Bot is an intelligent question-answering system that uses retrieval-augmented generation to provide accurate responses based on your documents. The application allows users to upload PDF documents to the data folder, which are then processed and used as a knowledge base for answering queries.

The system combines the power of large language models with a retrieval component that finds relevant information from your documents before generating responses, resulting in more accurate and context-aware answers.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive web interface
- PDF document processing
- Intelligent question answering based on your documents
- Responsive design with Bootstrap

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended)
